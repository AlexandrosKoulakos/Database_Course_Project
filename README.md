# Database_Course_Project

This repository concerns the course of Databases (6th Semester, ECE - NTUA). Our goal is to design and construct a fully functional database which is used by an imaginary hotel (ASDF Hotel) so that potentially covid - 19 cases can be tracked. The effectiveness of our database is highlighted through a web app presentation.

Inside "ASDF_Hotel" folder, you can find the SQL code that helped us set up our database ("create_all.sql" contains all "CREATE" definitions) and solve the necessary queries ("code.sql"). Also, you can find our database server file called "Hotel.db" for which we used SQLite3. Finally, you will find the python file "server.py" that is responsible for connecting the web page to our database server. For this connection we extensively used Flask (Python framework). Folder named "templates" contains .html files for all possible information that our web page displays. Bootstrap elements are contained in these files and improve the styling of the page.
